## 📋 Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- OpenAI API Key (for AI chat functionality)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawn14/BibleAI.git
cd BibleAI
```

### 2. Get an OpenAI API Key
1. Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account if you don't have one
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key

### 3. Configure the App
1. Open `BibleAI/Config.swift`
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual OpenAI API key:
```swift
struct Config {
    static let openAIAPIKey = "sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE"
}
```
3. Save the file

**Important**: Never commit your actual API key to version control! The `Config.private.swift` file is gitignored for this reason.

### 4. Build and Run
1. Open `BibleAI.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select a simulator or device
3. Press `Cmd + R` to build and run

### 5. Start Chatting!
1. Go to Chat tab
2. Tap "Start New Conversation"
3. Ask questions about scripture!

## 💡 Example Questions to Try

- "What does John 3:16 mean?"
- "Explain the context of Romans 8:28"
- "What is the significance of Jesus's conversation with Nicodemus?"
- "Compare different interpretations of Revelation 21"
- "What can Psalm 23 teach me about trust?"

## 🎯 Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
- **Models**: Data structures (Message, Conversation, BibleVerse)
- **Views**: SwiftUI UI components
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management
- **Services**: API calls and data persistence

### Data Flow
```
User Input → ChatViewModel → AIService → OpenAI API
                ↓                          ↓
         ConversationService ← Response ←─┘
                ↓
          UserDefaults (Persistence)
```

### AI System Prompt
The AI is configured to:
- Provide historical and theological context
- Reference original languages (Greek/Hebrew)
- Show multiple Christian perspectives
- Ask Socratic questions to deepen understanding
- Suggest practical applications
- Maintain warmth and accessibility

- **No Analytics**: Zero tracking or data collection
- **OpenAI**: Follows OpenAI's data usage policies

## 🛠 Development Commands

### Build for Simulator
```bash
xcodebuild -project BibleAI.xcodeproj -scheme BibleAI -sdk iphonesimulator -configuration Debug build
```

### Build for Device
```bash
xcodebuild -project BibleAI.xcodeproj -scheme BibleAI -sdk iphoneos -configuration Release build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
xcodebuild test -project BibleAI.xcodeproj -scheme BibleAI -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

## 📊 Competitive Differentiation

Unlike existing Bible apps, BibleAI offers:

1. **Conversational AI**: Not just verse lookup, but deep discussion and understanding
2. **Multi-perspective**: Shows different theological interpretations fairly
3. **Contextual Intelligence**: Understands your questions in context of previous conversation
4. **Socratic Teaching**: Asks questions to deepen understanding
5. **Personalization**: Adapts to your learning style and theological background

## 💰 Monetization Strategy (Future)

## 📱 App Store Preparation

Before submitting to App Store:
1. Update bundle identifier if needed
2. Configure code signing with your Apple Developer account
3. Create app icon (1024x1024px)
4. Take screenshots for all required device sizes
5. Write App Store description
6. Set up in-app purchases (if using premium features)
7. Archive and submit via Xcode

## 💰 Cost Optimization

The app uses **GPT-4o-mini** (~$0.15 per 1M tokens) instead of GPT-4 (~$30 per 1M tokens) - **200x cheaper!**

### Built-in Cost Controls:
- **Daily Limit**: 50 requests per day (resets at midnight)
- **Rate Limit**: 10 requests per minute
- **Token Limit**: 500 tokens max per response
- **Context Window**: Only last 5 messages sent for context

### Estimated Costs:
- **50 messages/day**: ~$0.60/month
- **1,500 messages/month**: ~$0.60/month (with limits)

See `AI_COST_OPTIMIZATIONS.md` for detailed analysis.

## 🐛 Known Issues / TODO

- [x] Add proper Bible API integration (using bible-api.com)
- [ ] Implement error retry mechanism for failed API calls
- [x] Add loading states for Bible verse lookups
- [ ] Implement conversation export/sharing
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle
- [x] Optimize API token usage (GPT-4o-mini + rate limits)
